# Never `git commit` the contents of `build`
# (or any other content generated by Documenter)
# to your repository's `master` branch.
# Always commit generated files to the `gh-pages`
# branch of your repository. This helps to avoid 
# including unnessesary changes for anyone reviewing
#  commits that happen to include documentation
# changes.
